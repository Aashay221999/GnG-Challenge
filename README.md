All the Things

This one's dedicated to all the hackers

Even out settle score quick
My disaster recovery requires even more disks
Put your bytes up, prove it or you forfeit
Got my C64 and we blew it into orbit

M. Bison with eight straight perfects
Overload emotions make hate, break circuits
In case you heard, it's a name fake service
Optimize our runtime to escape verdicts

Got an integer scope flow
That they can't sign
Passing code, didn't sanitize
Command lines; land mine

So before, they'll see me after
I'm Advice dog
Courage Wolf
Plus Philosoraptor

Don't prove we're human unless we really hafta
My team built schemes that destroyed recaptcha
Hate what they see, finish this chapter
By the way we're not any geeks, we hack into NASA

Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things

Got this Vodka and this Redbull
They still give me wings

So we drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things

Zero through Three
We're in every single ring

I'm just waiting until my blackberry dies
Cause I'll replace it with a raspberry pi

Don't compare to this track
It makes everything they said dull
Neutralize any threat
Turn Red skull to dev null

They killed virus writers that we mentioned
But instead they ascended to the VXHeavens
To reincarnate as live wires
Still inside we hide ciphers in signed device drivers

Which school will we hit next?
They didn't learn the format
So we've gotta printf
Next step is a chin check
Freestyles that I spit best
They didn't decrypt yet

I crush internet MC's in rhyme battles
Get your WiFi tackled
Hak5 Pineapple
I don't think you'll like my snapple
Find more lyrics at â€» Mojim.com
Cause I popped it with vodka
And a cyanide capsule

We drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things

Got this Vodka and this Redbull
They still give me wings

So we drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things

First we drink all the booze
Then we hack all the things
Then backdoor the firmware
On anything you bring

Regardless of the hardware, service, or encoding
Connected it to the internet
And someone's gonna own it

This is for the pirates who clap
And love the sound
Attacking from the cloud
Then we're back in underground

There's no masking from us now
We pop Tor nodes around the globe
Track and hunt you down
Hacked on schedule, add it to your calendar
Devices online; here comes another challenger

State infiltrated, so undercover
This is for my comrades who stare at their debuggers
And trace every buffer
Examining the code flow
Haven't been to sleep? Better pop another No-Doz

I think I'll need a planet sized urn
Cause some men just wanna see the world burn
Your turn

Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things

Got this zodka and this Redbull
They still give me wings

So we drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things
Drink all the booze
Hack all the things

Zero through three
We're in every single ring
